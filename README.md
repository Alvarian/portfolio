# port
My portfolio. Technology stack is HTML, flask and AWS S3 bucket only to write in legacy version(currently disabled in this version). Hosted on heroku, using postgres add-on for database. This version is just representing the structure of what I want my final version to have, using different and more personally preferred web stacks.

# Testiment
Although I will not use this application to represent my portfolio in the long term, I thoroughly enjoyed, using the need to have a portfolio up and running, as an excuse to get to know python.
